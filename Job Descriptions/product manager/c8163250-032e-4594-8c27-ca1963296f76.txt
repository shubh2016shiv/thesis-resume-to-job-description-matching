The Kiev team will not just be a development arm of a Londonbased team though. London will focus on strategic goals and select the projects; the permanent team in Kiev will be responsible for product design and delivery. The Division intends to deliver eight new projects within the first twelve months; each involving approximately **** development hours to reach Beta release status. The resources for this development will be supplied by Ciklum's Project Office  and managed by the permanent Kiev team. The three key roles in Kiev are; Project Director; responsible for management of all the projects and the permanent team User Experience Manager; responsible for the user experience of all products Lead Development Engineer; responsible for development standards and approaches within all teams The London team consists, currently, of the Director and Product Manager.

An appreciation of audience demographics and the ability to segment and target based on that needs to be demonstrated.

This is a fantastic opportunity for the right person; you will have a high degree of autonomy and the ability to make things happen, typical of a startup operation, but on the scale and with the audience that a massive media company can leverage.
