About the job
The Product Manager is the magic in the middle of our product teams. Understanding what our customers want, what the business wants, and what is technically possible is no easy challenge! You’ll be able to understand these (sometimes conflicting) needs and synthesise them into something tangible.

We have 7 teams that build our products, and you’ll manage the end-to-end delivery of products coming out of either Community or Responsible Gambling teams. You don’t need to know too much about what these are just yet, we have plenty of domain expertise already that will only be too keen to help you learn.

What you’ll bring is that innate inquisitiveness, innovation and intelligence to see where value can be added, and which ideas are worth pursuing (and which ones aren’t).

The reality is that priorities change, some things will work better than anyone expected, and some won’t. You’ll need to be constantly looking at what’s being done and what needs to be done, asking “How are we helping our players?”

You don’t need to be a Product Manager right now. If you can talk to us about how you can manage these competing priorities, always bringing fresh solutions to the needs of customers, then we’d like to chat.

Stuff you’ve possibly done in the past:

Listened intently to customers; understood what they want and what’s possible
Come up with new ways of delighting customers.
Changed your viewpoint. If the information changes, so does your opinion.
Stood up for what you believed in and took people with you.
Influenced others, especially those with fancier job titles than yours.
Managed back logs and roadmaps spotting opportunities to add value at the earliest opportunity.
Spun plates! (If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs…)

Any nice perks?

How about free food? Breakfasts, lunches, snacks, coffee? It's on us. (Our chefs will make you something special if you don't fancy what's on the menu) 🥘
Pension - we'll match your contribution and add 2% 💰
Bonus - paid quarterly 💸
Healthcare from day 1 🏥
On site gym (to work off that free food) 😅
