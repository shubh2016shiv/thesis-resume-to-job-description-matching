Title: Quantitive Developer
Full Description: The Client: My client currently has an exciting opportunity for a Quantitative Developer to join their existing team. They are working with a large database of domestic energy readings, developing algorithms to derive consumer and utility insight that can be deployed at scale. This includes appliance disaggregation, personalized energy usage, tariff design and other business insight. The successful individual will join the existing team to work on developing algorithms to extract insight from smart metering and other energy data. These algorithms are designed to work at scale, and are incorporated in utility insight systems that server millions of customers. Responsibilities: The role requires high level mathematical analysis skills to identify short and long term characteristics and trends from the data, identifying what energy is being used for and how this relates to behavioral patterns. The primary function of this role is the development of energy tools for the analysis of electricity and gas usage. This will involve working closely with our data scientists to develop new tools. Additional responsibilities include the research and development of further algorithms and data analysis processes that may be transformed into software agents by our development team and implemented in commercially available analysis engines. Requirements: PhD level qualification, from one of maths, computer science, engineering or the physical sciences. Skilled in the use of Matlab for development. Experience in working with large data sets Documentation of methods and concepts to ensure that the algorithms and processes can be turned into high quality, optimised production code. Ideally possess a background in research in one or more of machine learning, time series analysis, and/or pattern recognition. If you are a good fit for this role, then please send your CV to
