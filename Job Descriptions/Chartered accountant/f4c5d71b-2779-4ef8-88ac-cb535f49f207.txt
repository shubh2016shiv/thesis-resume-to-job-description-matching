Title: Accounts Manager
Full Description: This is an excellent opportunity for an individual with drive and enthusiasm to enter into a new role that has arisen within this growing large regional firm of Chartered Accountants in one of their North West Leicestershire offices. You will be responsible for managing a varied portfolio of mainly non audit SME clients but also be keen to assist with the growth within the firm. Your broad role will involve planning, supervision and review of clientsâ€™ financial and management accounts production including preparing notes for partners; preparation of business tax computations; assisting, appraising and managing staff with technical accounting problems. We are therefore seeking someone with energy, strong influencing skills and who takes pride in their work. You will be a qualified accountant, either ACA or ACCA. We expect the successful candidate to be a handson selfstarter with proven managerial skills and experience and the ability to build strong relationships both internally and externally with clients. You will also be confident to identify opportunities within your clients and cross sell the services of the firm. There are genuine opportunities for partnership in the future for the right individual who has that desire but quite equally you could have a very successful management career as well.
