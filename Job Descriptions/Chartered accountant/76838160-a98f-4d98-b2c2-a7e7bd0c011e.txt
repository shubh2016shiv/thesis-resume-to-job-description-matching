Title: Tax Semi Senior
Full Description: This Top 20 firm of Chartered Accountants is seeking to further strengthen its tax advisory group by recruiting a Personal Tax Semi Senior. This is an excellent opportunity for an individual committed to a career in tax to work in a well established but growing Sports and Entertainment team. You will work on a range of bespoke tax planning and transactional cases for both individual and corporate clients in the sector. Experience of relevant tax issues affecting such clients would be helpful, but not essential as training would be given to the right candidate. This is a challenging and interesting client facing role in which you will have responsibility for your own wide ranging portfolio of clients, often working to tight deadlines. To apply successfully, you will be an ambitious graduate with the ATT qualification and be studying for (or have recently obtained) the CTA qualification. An interest in clients in this sector would be an advantage. A comprehensive package in addition to basic salary will be offered to the successful candidate.
