THE JOB AND PROSPECTS: There is very strong growth in the company&x2019 s new C team at present. They prefer to fund growth from within, meaning that existing employees working on older technologies are moved across and crosstrained. Therefore, there is a realistic possibility of moving to C in the future. With Delphi arguably in decline, could this be a useful boost or safeguard to your career?

Being music, entertainment and film it&x2019 s an interesting industry to work in too. You&x2019 ll be involved in different technologies across the board from front office to back office. The large number of people I have placed here who are still there years later are testament to this Location is London, near Euston and King&x2019 s Cross
