Title: Software Developer
Full Description: Working at Manything is an opportunity to work with a highly experienced team, earn a stake in a new company, and to make a big contribution to the early stages of a startup venture. You’ll be working in a classic startup environment: you’ll be expected to work hard, manage your own time, and become part of the DNA of a fast moving company. We’re looking for one or two people who can develop across a range of technologies. Our product is in the mobile/web/video space, and so there are opportunities to work in web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, middleware such as Java, Node.js, Python, backend on Amazon Web Services platforms, as well as mobile development in Android and iOS. Any experience you might have is a bonus but intelligence, drive and enthusiasm are more important to us. If you can show us some excellent code you’ve written then that would be great too. The people behind Manything are interesting too. The founders include two FTSE 250 CEOs, the founder of the world’s largest stock photo collection, and the creative director of Innocent Drinks. We’re based in Milton Park in Oxfordshire. Please contact us at jobsmanything.com with a **** page CV and a covering letter explaining why we should be talking to you.
