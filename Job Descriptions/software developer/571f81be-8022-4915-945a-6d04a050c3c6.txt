Full Description: Delphi Developer ****k  ****k  Music & Entertainment Industry  London Location is London, near Euston and King's Cross Salary: Max **** plus Bonus and good benefits package THE COMPANY: Due to an increased demand for their marketleading product, the world leader in the provision of software solutions to the Music and Entertainment industry needs an experienced Delphi Developer. Additionally, this is a very pleasant working environment  casual dress code, laid back and friendly atmosphere and a genuine prospect of crosstraining to C in the future. They are currently working with the latest XE**** version of Delphi. EXPERIENCE REQUIRED: The experience required to be eligible for this role is as follows:  A minimum of 5 years commercial experience in Delphi development  Commercial RDB experience (preferably SQL Server or Oracle)  Excellent standard of written English  Adaptable, flexible, team player And that's it We just want good Delphi people with RDB experience (although if you happen to have any C experience too, that would be an advantage). THE JOB AND PROSPECTS: There is very strong growth in the company's new C team at present. They prefer to fund growth from within, meaning that existing employees working on older technologies are moved across and crosstrained. Therefore, there is a realistic possibility of moving to C in the future. With Delphi arguably in decline, could this be a useful boost or safeguard to your career? We need people who are amenable to carrying out pure development initially, however prospects here are fantastic: Most of the current managers there started off as developers. Some are running their own products, others are in technical management, and others now deal with company clients. Here, you will have enough autonomy to define your own role. Therefore, if you take the initiative you can shape your role for the future and drive your own progression. This company caters for all personality types though  you don't HAVE to be an ambitious gogetter. If you're not keen on progressing to a clientfacing situation and would rather just stay and develop, that is also fine by them. They need fullon software developers Overall, this is a lovely place to work  it's a privatelyowned company and feels more like a family company, not at all institutionalised  everyone has a stake, everyone has a say. Being music, entertainment and film it's an interesting industry to work in too. You'll be involved in different technologies across the board from front office to back office. The large number of people I have placed here who are still there years later are testament to this Location is London, near Euston and King's Cross delphi developer ****k ****k music entertainment industry london
