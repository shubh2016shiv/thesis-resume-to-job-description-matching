Title: Software/Web Development Manager
Full Description: My Milton Keynes based client is looking to recruit a Development Manager/Development Team leader to join their technical department. Working closely with the Director of Development you will manage, motivate and lead a team of Front End Software Developers/Engineers whose technical include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Perl and PHP. It would be preferable if you too had a Front End Coding background and were confident with these languages, however for the right person my client can relax this requirement. It's essential that you are an inspirational leader with proven experience working as a Software Development Manager. It is key that you have managed teams of programmers and whilst you will not necessarily be developing code on a day to day basis you must have a good understanding of programming. A Front End background is preferred as is a flexible attitude to embrace new technologies; you will also have a flair for leading and motivate technical personnel. A brief summary of skills which could be highly useful for this manager to possess include PHP, Perl, Python, JavaScript, AJAX and HTML. Linux knowledge is also preferable. Milton Keynes is easily commutable from a number of locations such as Newport Pagnell, Olney, Northampton, Cranfield, Bedford and Luton.
